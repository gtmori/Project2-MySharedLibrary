### 4. Invite people to the library

Now that you have created a library and added a few books to it, it’s time to invite people to be part of it and make it SharedLIbrary.

Copy the link on the upper right side of the screen and send to your friends. Once they created their account and loged in, they will be indicated to be part of the library and add the books they have to the library.
